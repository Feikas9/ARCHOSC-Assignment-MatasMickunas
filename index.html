    <h1>My name is: Matas Mickunas</h1>
    <p>I have followed instructions as provided and have created a local storage container with sub folders and screenshotted the entire thing. I have also created a word doc explaining what I have done.

Task3
I have followed instructions and created a new repository in github

Task 4
I have created a link between GitHub and local. And created repositories. I have inputted it incorrectly at first so had to replace it. Also I have removed a new word doc since it was not required and combined it with the current place holder

 Task6
